# Anime Sentry

## Operation principle

- You send the bot a link to an anime.
- The bot mentions the release time of the episode.
- The bot checks every half hour, according to the cron schedule, whether a new anime episode has been released (with voice acting or subtitles).
- You can opt out of notifications for a specific anime, and the bot will stop notifying you about the release of new episodes.
